# SNV-WebPortal-Reverse-Engineering

This repository contains a collection of resources I wrote whilst reverse engineering the SNV-WebPortal, a web application used by many german schools to manage student data.

The applications main use is to provide students with access to the data on the school systems from home.

The use of this repository is to provide a easy to use reference for developers who want to interact with SNV web applications and for myself to write a cli wrapper for it.

## Table of Contents

-   actions.md: A list of all actions i reverse engineered from the web application.
-   README.md: This file.

In the snv-cli folder you will find a nodejs wrapper for the web application I wrote to check wheter the actions I reverse engineered are correct and to provide a easier way to interact with the web application.
